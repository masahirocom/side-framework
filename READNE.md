# SIDE Framework

**Structural Inversion Detection through Enquiry**  
A framework for identifying hidden misalignments of responsibility, authority, and structure through targeted questioning.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The SIDE Framework is a diagnostic tool for uncovering structural issues in organizations—especially where roles, responsibility, and decision-making authority have become inverted or unclear. It helps teams and leaders detect early signs of dysfunction in systems like Agile, Digital Transformation (DX), OKRs, and more.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

The framework revolves around four powerful questions:

1. **Who should be doing this?**  
   Clarifies the rightful owner of the action or responsibility.

2. **Do they have the authority or tools to act?**  
   Verifies whether the responsible party has sufficient power or means.

3. **Is the relationship appropriate?**  
   Evaluates power dynamics and organizational positioning.

4. **Is the misalignment structural or incidental?**  
   Helps distinguish systemic issues from temporary confusion.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Agile frameworks becoming procedural and ineffective  
- Digital Transformation initiatives causing complexity instead of clarity  
- Teams expected to act autonomously without the power to decide  
- KPIs/OKRs used for control instead of alignment

SIDE allows early detection and correction before these issues become deeply embedded.

## 📥 How to Use

1. Observe friction, confusion, or team fatigue  
2. Apply the four SIDE questions  
3. Map the structure (who decides, who acts, who supports)  
4. Use the insights to spark redesign or dialogue

Can be used in retrospectives, project launches, audits, coaching sessions, or leadership offsites.
