# SIDE Framework

*Structural Inversion Detection through Enquiry*

## Overview  
The SIDE Framework is a diagnostic thinking tool designed to detect structural misalignments within organizations or initiatives. It empowers individuals and teams to recognize when responsibility, authority, or roles have become inverted, misplaced, or dysfunctionalâ€”often through well-intended but poorly implemented systems such as Agile, DX, or OKRs.

## Purpose
To detect early-stage structural distortions and prevent organizational dysfunction by using structured questioning.

## Key Principles
The framework is built around four core questions:

1. **Who should be doing this?**  
   Clarifies the rightful owner of a task, responsibility, or role.

2. **Do they have the authority to do it?**  
   Verifies whether the responsible party has the necessary decision-making power or tools.

3. **What is the nature of the relationship?**  
   Explores whether power dynamics and dependencies are aligned appropriately.

4. **Is the misalignment structural or incidental?**  
   Differentiates between temporary confusion and systemic design flaws.

## Use Cases
- When Agile implementation stalls or becomes merely ceremonial.
- When Digital Transformation (DX) results in overload or fragmentation.
- When KPIs or OKRs lead to individual blame rather than systemic improvement.
- When team autonomy is expected but not supported.

## Application
1. Use the four questions during retrospectives, project launches, or leadership reviews.
2. Map the structure of who decides, who acts, and who supports.
3. Identify inversions or misalignments between responsibility and authority.
4. Initiate redesign or dialogue based on insights gathered.

## Benefits
- Prevents silent organizational failure by catching early symptoms.
- Supports cultural transformation by enabling honest structural reflection.
- Enhances agility, clarity, and psychological safety.

## Suggested Formats
- Slide decks for leadership workshops
- Workshop worksheets for team retrospectives
- Diagnostic checklist in coaching or audit formats
